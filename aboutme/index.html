    <h2>Quinn Briggs</h2>
    <h2>(aka Dad/Padre)</h2>
    <p>I'm originally from Teton, Idaho - about 10 minutes north and east of here. Throughout my life I've lived in Idaho, Utah and Maryland and have had many great experiences.</p>
    <p>I served a mission in Munich, Germany which is where I met my wife who as also a missionary at that time. I was her district leader for a few months before I went home. We've now been married 27 years.</p>
    <p>We have 8 kids, 2 in college, 2 in high school, 2 in junior high and 2 in elementary. They keep us very busy.</p>
    <p>Prior to joining the faculty at BYU-Idaho I worked in the software development industry for 20+ years. I worked for a tech startup, a health insurance company, government contractor, and well-known online retailer.</p>
    <p>I've held many positions including software developer (full-stack), principle engineer, engineering manager and director.</p>
    <p>I love to compose and arrange music for the piano and other instruments. I am a classical music junky and love late romantic composers like Rachmaninoff, Bruckner, Stanford, Nielsen and many others.</p>
    <p>I love to watch football and baseball. My teams are the Baltimore Orioles (who are the top team in the AL this season) and the Baltimore Ravens as well as both the Utah Utes and BYU Cougars.</p>
